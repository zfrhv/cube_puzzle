# Cube Puzzle
This program creates tetrist puzzles such as:  

![check ./product/intro.png](product/intro.png)

I tried to train AI to generate interesting shapes, but generating them myself was easier than making AI to do it for me.

# Examples
You can view already generated examples in every .obj file.  
All of them are solvable and the name states which shapes can be made from thos pieces.  
For example cube3_heart_chair_1.obj means that the tetris pieces can create cube 3x3x3, heart in 2d, chair in 3d, and its the first sample of the pieces.  

# Generating new puzzle
The shape for the software to test for are located at shapes.py.  
To generate a new shape please run the _0_create_connection_manual.py.

# Licence
You can use it for personal usage but not selling purposes (uploading for free on market websites is allowed).
If you do publish the code or the products for GA, please give a credit (mention this github page).
If you are still interested in selling the code/products please contact me.
